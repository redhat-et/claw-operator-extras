// Detecting what an agent actually wrote to memory, and when.
//
// Nothing in OpenClaw records this. Consolidation and wiki synthesis write
// files directly, with no trajectory event and no commit, so the only way to
// know what changed is to watch. The console keeps the last content it saw for
// each note and diffs on change, which yields the added lines and the moment
// they appeared.
//
// The state is persisted, and that is what makes the feed useful rather than a
// curiosity. Held only in memory it was lost on every restart, and the baseline
// was re-taken in silence — so the page reported nothing had happened when in
// fact the console had simply forgotten. Written to disk, the first read after
// a restart diffs against the last content actually seen, so a write that
// happened while the console was down still appears with its real lines.
//
// The watcher is shared by every user who can read a Claw, because it describes
// the Claw and not the viewer. That is safe precisely because reaching it at
// all requires a read the API server already authorized under the user's own
// token.
//
// Two honest limits remain. Detection advances only when someone loads the
// memory page — the console cannot poll on its own, since it holds no standing
// permission to read any Claw. And several writes to one note between two reads
// are reported as the one diff that spans them.
